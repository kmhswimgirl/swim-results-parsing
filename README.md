# **Python Scripting: Swim Meet Data** #
This script currenlty can sort .txt files by event or you can search a name to see individual results.

Future Additions:
* Room for input error with abbreviation such as "FR" or "free" equating to typing in Freestyle
* Searching multiple meets at once
* Time analytics for longer distance races as well as yardage markers (eg 28.40, 50 YD)
* More details regarding relays

_**Will soon be turned into a webscraping project_
